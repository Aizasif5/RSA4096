RSA4096 project:
	Using 4096-bit registers to do Montgomery Exponentiation to implement RSA encryption.

	The algorithm is derivative CIOS method: http://cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/cs290g/docs/w01/mon1.pdf
	The implementation is based on this: ModExp4096.pdf


	Explanation to folders and files is below.

Python and Mathematica code:
	This folder includes codes which generate parameters  m, e, n, n0', r, t, etc. Looks chaotic but you can get the idea.
